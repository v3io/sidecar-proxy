# Sidecar Proxy

A containerized proxy meant to run alongside a service (in the same pod) in order to serve Prometheus metrics, and
facilitate scale-to-zero flows.

Supported metrics:
1. General:
    * `num_of_requests` - prometheus `CounterVec` that simply counts requests using a reverse proxy (Go's built in ReverseProxy)<br>
2. Service specific:
    * Jupyter:
        * `jupyter_kernel_busyness` - prometheus `GaugeVec` that is set to 1 if Jupyter has one or more busy kernels, 
        and to 0 otherwise. Periodically queries Jupyter's `/api/kernels` endpoint

The container includes a server that serves Prometheus metrics through the `/metrics` endpoint.

All metrics contain these labels: `namespace`, `service_name`, `instance_name`.

The code was built, so it will be easy to extend it and add new metrics. This is performed by creating a new metric 
handlers that implement the `MetricsHandler` interface.

When starting the container the `--metric-name` flag (can be defined multiple times) is used to set which metrics 
handlers to run (`num_of_requests` is mandatory).

An example helm chart that adds this container alongside a Jupyter service can be found
